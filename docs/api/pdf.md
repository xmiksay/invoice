# PDF (phase 1d)

Documents are rendered to PDF by the mdcast service (`POST {INVOICE__MDCAST_URL}/v1/render/template`, crate
`mdcast-client` 0.4.2): one typst template (`invoice.typ`) + a JSON payload the template reads with
`json("/data.json")` + an asset bundle (design files, fonts, the generated QR code).

## Design files

- The default design is embedded in the binary from the repo directory `design/`: `invoice.typ`, `fonts/Inter-*.ttf`
  (+ `fonts/OFL.txt`). Minimalist layout, black/grey, one accent colour, no logo.
- The storage keys `design/…` (see [Storage](#storage)) override it **file by file**: the effective set is embedded ∪
  `design/`, the stored file wins on the same relative path (`design/logo.svg` → `logo.svg`). The prefix is listed on
  every render (design edits apply without a restart); file contents are cached in memory by key + version (ETag,
  size, modification time from the listing), so only new or changed files are downloaded. Hidden files
  (`.`-prefixed path segments) are ignored; a file > 10 MB → render fails (`pdf_render_failed`, checked on the
  listed size before any download). Files get there with `invoice design push <dir>` (or straight into the bucket);
  `invoice design pull <dir>` / `ls` / `rm <path>…` complete the set.
- Every `fonts/**/*.ttf|*.otf` is registered with the typst font book (request `fonts`, sorted by path); every other
  file goes into the bundle under its relative path, so `#image("logo.png")` / `#import "parts.typ"` resolve like on a
  filesystem.
- Optional well-known files: `logo.svg` or `logo.png` (svg wins), `signature.png` (stamp/signature above the
  "Issued by" line). The template cannot test file existence, so the payload carries `assets.logo` /
  `assets.signature` = the relative path or `null`.
- `qr.svg` is reserved: generated per render, it replaces any design file of that name.

## Payload (`/data.json`)

Every displayed value is a **pre-formatted string** in the document's locale (the template does no number/date
formatting); labels are resolved server-side, so the template carries no hardcoded text. Missing values are `null`.

```
{
  locale: "cs" | "en",
  draft: boolean,                       // true → template draws the "NÁVRH" / "DRAFT" watermark

        ids: [string] /* "IČO: …", "DIČ: …" — only present ones */, contact: [string] /* email, phone, web */ }
Line  { kind: "item" | "text" | "subtotal" | "advance", description, quantity /* "2 ks" */, unitPrice, discount,
        vatRate /* "21 %" */, base, strong: boolean }
```

- Lines follow the document order; members of a **collapsed** subtotal are omitted, the subtotal itself is printed
  as a regular row (`kind: "subtotal"`, its quantity/unit price `null`). Non-collapsed subtotals print as a bold
  summary row after their members. `text` lines carry only `description`. Advance (deduction) lines print with a
  negative base. Credit-note amounts print **negated** (the stored positive values × sign).
- Money: `cs` → `1 234,50 Kč` (NBSP thousands, comma decimal, currency symbol for CZK/EUR/USD else the code after),
  `en` → `CZK 1,234.50`. Quantities trimmed of trailing zeros. Dates: `cs` `8. 10. 2026`, `en` `8 Oct 2026`.
- Exchange rate note (`vatRecapCzk.rateNote`): `Kurz ČNB 24,400 CZK/EUR ze dne 7. 10. 2026` (source `manual` →
  "Kurz 24,400 CZK/EUR", `original` → same as cnb of the original).

### Titles
| docType | cs | en |
|---|---|---|
| invoice (standard / reverse_charge / exempt) | Faktura – daňový doklad | Invoice – tax document |
| invoice (non_payer) | Faktura | Invoice |
| proforma | Zálohová faktura | Proforma invoice |
| credit_note | Opravný daňový doklad | Credit note |
| advance_tax_doc | Daňový doklad k přijaté platbě | Tax document for a received payment |

The tax point (DUZP) row is omitted for proformas and non-payers; the due date row is omitted for DDPPs.

### Legal texts
- `reverse_charge`: cs "Daň odvede zákazník (přenesení daňové povinnosti, § 92a zákona o DPH)." / en "Reverse charge –
  VAT to be accounted for by the customer."
- `exempt`: cs "Plnění osvobozené od DPH." / en "VAT exempt supply."
- `non_payer`: cs "Dodavatel není plátcem DPH." / en "The supplier is not a VAT payer."

### SPAYD QR
Present only when **all** hold: not a draft, `docType ∈ {invoice, proforma}`, `paymentMethod = bank_transfer`, the bank
snapshot has an IBAN, `payable > 0`. Generated server-side as SVG (crate `qrcode`), string:
`SPD*1.0*ACC:{IBAN}[+{BIC}]*AM:{payable, 2 dp, '.'}*CC:{currency}*DT:{dueDate YYYYMMDD}[*X-VS:{vs}][*X-KS:{ks}]*MSG:{title number, ≤60 chars}`;
`*` inside values is stripped, MSG is ASCII-folded (no diacritics).

## Archive

- Columns on `documents`: `pdf_path text null` (the storage key `documents/{numberYear}/{id}.pdf`),
  `pdf_sha256 text null`, `pdf_rendered_at timestamptz null`. Written atomically (see [Storage](#storage)).
- **Issue** (`POST /api/documents/{id}/issue`, all doc types) renders and archives inside the issue transaction after
  the number and snapshots are assigned; render or storage failure → transaction rolls back, nothing is issued (503
  `pdf_unavailable` / 502 `pdf_render_failed` / 503 `storage_unavailable`); commit failure → the written file is
  removed (best effort).
- **DDPP** (auto-issued with a payment): the payment never fails because of PDF. After the payment transaction
  commits, the handler tries to render + archive once (failure logged). A DDPP without an archive is rendered and
  archived on its first `GET …/pdf` (concurrent first downloads: `UPDATE … WHERE pdf_path IS NULL`, the loser serves
  its own bytes).
- The archive is **immutable**: never re-rendered, also not after cancel or a design change.

## Routes

- `GET /api/documents/{id}/pdf?download=1` → `200 application/pdf`, `Content-Disposition: inline` (`attachment` with
  `download=1`), filename `{number}.pdf` (draft: `draft-{first 8 chars of id}.pdf`), `Cache-Control: no-store`.
  - draft → rendered live, `draft: true`, never stored;
  - issued / cancelled with an archive → the stored file, streamed with `Content-Length` (sha256 not re-checked);
  - issued / cancelled without an archive (DDPP only) → render + archive, as above;
  - archive object missing → 500 (logged); storage unreachable → 503 `storage_unavailable`.
- `GET /api/pdf/preview?locale=cs|en` → `200 application/pdf` of a sample invoice (never stored): supplier = the
  company profile (placeholder name when empty), fictional customer, CZK, standard VAT, items at 21 % and 12 %, one
  with a 10 % discount, a collapsed subtotal group, a text line, bank = default CZK account (if any → QR shown),
  `draft: false`, number `{YYYY}0001`-style sample. `locale` missing → company `defaultLocale`; invalid → 422.
- `GET /api/pdf/design` → `{ storage: "fs" | "s3", files: [ { path, source: "custom" | "default", size } ] }`
  (effective set, sorted by path; `custom` = from the storage's `design/`).

Fetch the PDF with the Bearer header (blob → object URL); a plain link cannot carry the token.

## Errors
- 503 `{"code":"pdf_unavailable"}` — mdcast unreachable, token rejected, gateway 502–504.
- 503 `{"code":"storage_unavailable"}` — the storage (directory or bucket) failed: design listing / download, archive
  write or read. The cause is logged only.
- 502 `{"code":"pdf_render_failed","detail":"…"}` — mdcast answered but the template failed (typst diagnostics), or a
  design file is too large. `detail` is the mdcast message (the template is the user's own; no DB/internal data).
- Document `pdf` field (added to the Document DTO): `{ sha256, renderedAt } | null`.

## Configuration
| Env var | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `INVOICE__MDCAST_URL` | `https://mdcast.nexial.cz` | empty → default |
| `INVOICE__MDCAST_TOKEN` | — | optional Bearer for mdcast |
| `INVOICE__STORAGE_KIND` | `fs` | `fs` or `s3` (see [Storage](#storage)) |
| `INVOICE__STORAGE_DIR` | `./data` | `fs` root, created at start; Docker image uses `/data` (volume) |
| `INVOICE__S3__ENDPOINT` / `BUCKET` / `REGION` / `ACCESS_KEY_ID` / `SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` / `PATH_STYLE` | — / — / `us-east-1` / — / — / `false` | `s3` only; endpoint empty → AWS |

mdcast HTTP timeout 60 s.

## Storage

All files (archives, originals, design overrides) go through one `Storage` (`src/storage/`, crate `object_store`):
put (returns sha256; atomic — `fs` writes a temp file, fsyncs it, renames and fsyncs the directory; an S3 PUT is
atomic), get (whole or streamed), delete (idempotent), exists / head, list by prefix. Keys are `/`-separated, never
contain empty, `.` or `..` segments: `documents/{year}/{id}.pdf`, `documents/{year}/{id}-original-{sha8}.pdf`,
`design/…`.

- `fs` (default): `INVOICE__STORAGE_DIR`. `s3`: any S3-compatible service; bucket, access key id and secret are
  required, `PATH_STYLE=true` for Garage / MinIO. Invalid settings (unknown kind, missing bucket / credentials,
  endpoint without `http(s)://`, unparsable `PATH_STYLE`) → the server refuses to start. Reachability is probed once
  at start and only logged.
- S3 requests: 5 s connect timeout, 30 s read timeout (each wait for headers or the next chunk; no total timeout, so a
  slow 20 MB download is not cut off), at most 2 retries within 15 s — then 503 `storage_unavailable`.
- Virtual-hosted style (`PATH_STYLE=false`) with a custom endpoint puts the bucket into the host
  (`https://s3.example` → `https://{bucket}.s3.example`; unchanged when the host already starts with `{bucket}.`).
- A leftover `INVOICE__DESIGN_DIR` refuses the start (its files would silently stop applying).
- A failed original upload or ISDOC import (write or commit) removes the possibly written object again, unless a
  document row points at that key (keys are content-addressed).
- `invoice storage migrate --from-dir <old INVOICE__STORAGE_DIR> [--design-dir <old INVOICE__DESIGN_DIR>]` copies
  every non-hidden file into the configured backend (keys = relative paths; the design dir under `design/`), reads
  each one back and compares sha256. Identical objects are skipped (re-runs are no-ops; decided by size + the MD5
  ETag of single-part S3 objects without a download, by downloading when the ETag is no MD5, e.g. fs); an existing
  object with different content is reported and kept; unreadable local entries (a dangling symlink, an unreadable
  `lost+found`) are skipped and reported. Any problem → exit code 1 after the rest is copied. The source is never
  modified. `invoice design rm` of a path that is not stored prints "not found" and exits 1.

## Clarifications (as implemented)

- **Party snapshots** gained optional `email`, `phone`, `web` (company: all three, contact: email + phone); snapshots
  from before 1d read them as `null`. `Party.contact` is built from them; `Party.lines` adds the country name (16
  common codes in cs/en, else the code) unless `CZ`. A draft without a contact gets an empty customer party.
- **Extra payload fields** (so the template stays free of text): `watermark` (`"NÁVRH"`/`"DRAFT"` on a draft,
  `"STORNO"`/`"CANCELLED"` on a cancelled document rendered without an archive, else `null`); recaps carry `columns: { rate, base, vat, total }` header labels and `rateNote` (`null` on `vatRecap`);
  a recap `total` row's `rate` holds the "Celkem"/"Total" label; `columns.base` is "Základ"/"Net", for a non-payer
  "Celkem"/"Amount".
- **Empty env values** mean the default: `INVOICE__MDCAST_URL`, `INVOICE__MDCAST_TOKEN`, `INVOICE__STORAGE_KIND`,
  `INVOICE__STORAGE_DIR`, every `INVOICE__S3__*`.
- **Formatting**: negative money `-1 234,50 Kč` / `CZK -1,234.50`; `en` percent without a space (`21%`), `cs` with
  NBSP (`21 %`); dates use plain spaces; exchange rates print with at least 3 decimals.
- **Lines**: collapsed subtotals hide their members recursively (a member that is itself a subtotal hides its own
  members too). `vatRate` is `null` when `showVat` is false; `discount` is `null` for 0 %. An advance line prints as
  one row (description + negative base, no rate). Credit notes negate unit price, base, recaps and totals; the
  quantity stays positive.
- **Totals rows**: stored totals are net of advance deductions, so with advance lines the rows show total excl. VAT /
  VAT / total incl. VAT *before* the deduction, then "Odpočet záloh" (negative gross), then rounding (only when
  non-zero) and the payable (`strong`). Non-payer: one "Celkem" row instead of the three. DDPP: excl. VAT, VAT,
  total incl. VAT (`strong`), no payable row. The payable label is "K úhradě"/"Amount due" for every type (negative
  on a credit note).
- **Rows**: `payment` lists account number / IBAN (grouped by 4) / BIC only for `bank_transfer`; VS, KS and order
  reference whenever set. The DDPP "payment date" row is its tax point date.
- **Exchange-rate note** for `original` (credit notes): the original invoice's source and date are used (ČNB → dated
  note, manual → "Kurz …").
- **Archive on first download** applies to any issued/cancelled document without an archive (DDPPs, and documents
  issued before 1d), not only DDPPs. A cancelled one renders with the "STORNO" watermark and never a QR (the QR rule
  requires status `issued`). The DDPP archive after a payment runs in a background task once the payment has
  committed — the 201 is not delayed; a failure is only logged. The loser of the `WHERE pdf_path IS NULL` race
  serves the winner's stored file (not its own render), so every download returns the archived bytes.
- **Download**: `download=1` or `download=true` → `attachment`. The filename stem is reduced to `[A-Za-z0-9._-]`
  (others → `_`). A missing archive file → 500 `{"code":"internal"}`.
- **Error detail**: `detail` is only returned for genuine template failures (mdcast `render_failed`, i.e. typst
  diagnostics of the user's template) and our own design checks (file > 10 MB, non-UTF-8 `invoice.typ`). Any other
  mdcast failure (its 500 / `internal`, `payload_too_large`, an undecodable or unexpected answer) is 502
  `pdf_render_failed` **without** `detail`; the upstream body is logged only.
- **Design**: font files are bundled too (request `fonts` are keys into the bundle); `invoice.typ` is sent as the
  template source, not as an asset; `GET /api/pdf/design` also lists files over 10 MB (they only fail a render). An
  unreachable storage → 503 `storage_unavailable`. `design push` / `storage migrate` walk local directories
  following symlinks, each real directory entered once, so a link back into the tree (`shared -> .`) cannot loop.
  Embedded default files are passed to the bundle without copying in release builds; stored overrides come from the
  cache unless their listed version changed. (The client still hashes every asset per render to build the manifest —
  inherent to `AssetBundle`.) A non-UTF-8 `invoice.typ` → `pdf_render_failed`.
- **mdcast token**: without `INVOICE__MDCAST_TOKEN` a placeholder Bearer is sent (`mdcast-client` requires one; a
  server without a gate ignores it). `https://mdcast.nexial.cz` requires a real token for renders — without it every
  render is 503 `pdf_unavailable` (401 maps there).
- **Preview**: VAT mode `standard` and CZK regardless of the company's payer flag; due date = today + 14 days;
  supplier placeholder "Vaše firma s.r.o." / "Your Company Ltd." when the company name is empty; the bank is the
  default CZK account; VS = the sample number.
